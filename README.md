# palethorpe_rnaseq_srna_redo_2024-05-30

Redo analysis of Palethorpe's RNA-seq data for the 17978 RNAs derive from Kroger 2017.  This version has a fix due to an error in the Kroger 2017 table where sRNA29's length was listed as too long.

Used trimmed fastq files previously generated during my last analysis of this dataset.

Used a new GTF file: `srnas_17961_fixedlength_20240523.gtf`, which includes sRNA29.
